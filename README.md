This 5-stage pipelined processor was developed by Purnima Pant and Krishna Negi as part of our B.Tech. Major Project at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, under the guidance of Dr. Venkatnarayan Hariharan.

We undertook this project with the goal of deepening our understanding of processor design and computer architecture, and were able to achieve so with the help of the book Basic Computer Architecture authored by Prof. Smruti Ranjan Sarangi. The processor implements the SimpleRisc ISA, from the book ”Basic Computer Architecture” featuring five pipeline stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Operand Fetch (OF), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MA), and Write Back (WB).  

The processor supports only integer arithmetic and does not have support for hazards or cache memory at this stage. The repository includes essential modules such as a control unit, memory unit, ALU, and register file, all integrated within the top-level module. The input file used in the testbench for a simple program to calculate the factorial of 5 is given as Memory.mem and contains instructions encoded in hexadecimal format based on the SimpleRisc encoding procecure that can be found in the book "Basic Computer Architecture" by Prof. Smruti Sarangi. The format for the input memory file is "address-instruction". For example, a nop instruction at address 0x4 would be encoded as "0x4   0x68000000". An output file is generated after the completion of the program displaying the updated values in the memory and registers.
